abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel theory and provide empirical evidence on how a firm's R&D productivity relative to industry peers influences its R&D strategy. Our theoretical framework indicates that laggards with lower R&D productivity, in contrast to industry leaders, are more inclined to rely on technology licensing to bridge their productivity gap. The reason for this is that laggards, compared to leaders, are more likely to reach an optimal level of internal R&D investments earlier, which drives them towards using technology licensing. Therefore, additional internal R&D investment brings fewer benefits to low R&D productivity firms than to high R&D productivity firms. We also examine two crucial boundary conditions affecting the relationship between relative R&D productivity and licensing, the level of industry R&D investments and product market competition. Using a two-stage least squares (2SLS) instrumental variable approach, we find support for the idea that, as relative R&D productivity gaps increase, laggards will intensify their reliance on technology sourcing through technology licensing deals. Further, these findings support the notion that this relationship becomes stronger under conditions of increasing industry R&D investments and market competition. In doing so, we extend research examining leaders' and laggards' R&D strategies, as well as the determinants of the demand for technology.
